# TP-POO-Instrument

This TP was done in Java. 
You can visualize a menu that manages a stockage of instrument in a shop. 
You have three types of instruments, String instrument (violin...), Percussion instrument (drum, cymbal, charleston...) and keyboard intrument (upright piano...). 
You can add, delete, put in stock or in exposition all the instrument you want by fiding yourself with the barecode. 
It's possible to customize your drum, set an instrument as you want and tuning it and even set the price that suits you. 
Enjoy !
